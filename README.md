# Bamazon

Bamazon is a data driven js node command line application with a MySQL database backend that displays products for sale in a table.  

After launching the app the user is shown the table of items and  prompted to enter the name of the product they wish to purchase.

Then the user is asked how many units of the product they would like to buy.

Once the customer has placed the order, the application checks if the store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.

If not, the app logs "Not a Valid choice!!, and prevents the order from going through.

See attached screenshots.
